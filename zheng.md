title: What's Up with My Data? Exploring Privacy Laws Around the Globe
---

After reading two articles about personal data privacy published by Brian X. Chen in the New York Times in mid-2018, I became curious and also started to think about them. Since there is no rigorous research, this article is just my personal views and opinions. If there are any inappropriate points, I hope you can understand and correct me.

In Brian X. Chen's article, I felt the author was surprised, or more precisely, unexpected, about some of the personal data collected by some companies. The original article mentioned that some records that the author had deleted were still stored in Facebook's database, such as deleted friends and records of specific operation dates. What made me a little worried was a passage in the original article about contacts in the phone, which is as follows:

> One surprising part of my index file was a section called Contact Info. This contained the 764 names and phone numbers of everyone in my iPhone’s address book. Upon closer inspection, it turned out that Facebook had stored my entire phone book because I had uploaded it when setting up Facebook’s messaging app, Messenger.

> This was unsettling. I had hoped Messenger would use my contacts list to find others who were also using the app so that I could connect with them easily — and hold on to the relevant contact information only for the people who were on Messenger. Yet Facebook kept the entire list, including the phone numbers for my car mechanic, my apartment door buzzer and a pizzeria.

Reading these paragraphs sparked both curiosity and concern. What worries me is that if someone were to obtain this data, they could easily map out my daily life and potentially misuse it—for example, for kidnapping, framing, or even harming me. While these scenarios are unlikely, there are still more realistic risks. For instance, by comparing user data, some platform companies set higher prices for existing customers on the same products. This is not speculation; a few years ago, Ctrip, a Chinese online travel company, was exposed for charging different prices for the same flight at the same time to different users. As expected, the company was fined. After reading these articles, I began investigating my own data and was surprised to find that Google has stored my personal information for nearly 10 years. Fortunately, none of it made me as uncomfortable as Chen's experience—but I don't know whether it was selectively sent to me. All of this sparked my interest in learning more about data privacy protection laws. Below, I will discuss the similarities and differences between the relevant laws in the United States, the European Union, and China.

To understand how different regions handle data privacy, let's start with some key laws. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), enacted in 2018, offers comprehensive protection for personal data across the entire region. In the United States, notable privacy laws include the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which came into effect in California in 2018, as well as the nationwide Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) from 1996 and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) from 1998. In China, the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), implemented in 2021, works alongside the 2017 Cybersecurity Law and the 2021 Data Security Law (DSL) to create a robust regulatory framework for data and national security.
	
## Difference
**Legal Framework**

The GDPR provides a comprehensive and uniform legal framework across the European Union (EU), regulating all sectors and industries that handle the personal data of EU residents. In contrast, U.S. privacy laws are sectoral and state-based, with no overarching federal privacy law. Significant regulations include the CCPA, HIPAA, and COPPA, each focusing on specific areas of data protection. In China, the PIPL mirrors GDPR in its structure, overseeing the collection, processing, and storage of personal data. Additionally, the CSL and DSL address national security and data protection more broadly.

**User Rights*

The GDPR emphasizes individual rights, including access, correction, deletion (right to be forgotten), restriction, and data portability, while also allowing users to object to data processing. In contrast, U.S. laws vary by regulation; for instance, the CCPA grants consumers rights to access their data, request deletion, and opt out of data sales, but does not universally provide data portability or the right to be forgotten. In China, the PIPL offers similar rights to those under GDPR, such as access, correction, and deletion of data. However, considerations related to national security may override these individual rights.

*Consent*

The GDPR mandates explicit and informed consent for most data processing activities, with stringent rules governing how consent is obtained and documented. In contrast, U.S. laws have varied approaches: some regulations, like COPPA, require explicit consent, especially for children's data, while others, such as CCPA, focus on providing users the option to opt out of data sales rather than requiring opt-in consent. In China, PIPL also requires informed consent but permits broad exceptions for national security and public interest, allowing data processing without consent in certain cases.

*Enforcement and Penalties*

The GDPR imposes substantial fines for violations, reaching up to 4\% of annual global revenue or \€20 million, whichever is greater. U.S. laws feature varied penalty structures; for example, the CCPA allows for fines of up to \$7,500 per violation, while HIPAA and COPPA have their own specific penalties. In China, the PIPL enforces severe penalties, including fines up to 5\% of annual revenue. Serious breaches, particularly those affecting national security, can result in business shutdowns or personal penalties for company officers.

*Government Access to Data*

Under the GDPR, the EU imposes strict rules that limit government access to personal data, allowing such access only under specific legal conditions. In contrast, U.S. laws permit broader access by government agencies under statutes like the Patriot Act and FISA, often citing national security with fewer restrictions than those imposed by the GDPR. Meanwhile, in China, the government wields extensive powers to access and control data under the National Intelligence Law, CSL, and PIPL, with national security serving as a primary justification for accessing company-held data, mandating compliance from these entities.

## Similarity

All three regions—EU, U.S., and China—aim to protect individuals' personal data, though they prioritize different aspects. The GDPR emphasizes privacy rights, U.S. laws focus on consumer protection, and Chinese laws balance privacy with national security concerns. Transparency is a common requirement across all frameworks, mandating that companies inform users about data collection, processing, and purpose. Regarding user control, each system provides rights like access, deletion, and correction, though the extent of these rights varies. Data breach notifications are mandatory under the GDPR, U.S. state laws such as those in California, and China's PIPL, with specific requirements for timely reporting to both users and authorities. Enforcement is carried out by dedicated bodies such as the Data Protection Authorities (DPA) in the EU, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and state attorneys general in the U.S., and the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) under PIPL.

To wrap things up, diving into the different ways that places like the EU, the U.S., and China handle our personal data has been quite the eye-opener. Each region has its own set of rules, from the GDPR's broad protections in Europe to the patchwork of laws in the U.S. and China's focus on balancing privacy with national security. What's clear is that there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, but knowing what protections are out there can make a big difference.
For us as individuals, this means staying sharp about how our data is being used and understanding our rights. And for those making the laws? Well, they've got a tough job, but it's essential they keep pushing for rules that not only protect our data but also make the digital world a place we can trust and engage with freely—without worrying about our privacy being compromised (the most ideal state).
So, let's keep our eyes peeled, stay informed, and maybe even push for better protections. After all, in this digital age, our personal data is just about the most personal thing we've got!
